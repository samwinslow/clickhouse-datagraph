# clickhouse-datagraph
ClickHouse data exploration tool

## Getting started

Pull and run CH containers. With Docker installed, run `docker compose up -d`.

ClickHouse will now be listening on `localhost:8123`.

(WIP) Run `./scripts/populate` to create the table schema and load datasets from `datasets/aviation/cleaned`.
